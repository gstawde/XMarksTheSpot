Geography Learning Game
## Project Overview
A Country-Identification Content Based Game
1. User Dashboard
- User can get a token for each point milestone they achieve, which they can see in their collection (E.g. for every 100 points added to their overall player score, they get a flag to add to their wall)
- Dashboard will display tokens the user has earned
- Can see ranking number in comparison to existing users
2. Quiz Game
- Multiplayer game
- Users gain points based on answer accuracy, speed of answering the question, and question difficulty
- Bonuses awarded to game winner at the end
- Points earned during the game get added towards userâ€™s overall score (that earns them more tokens)
- Questions in set are randomly selected during game, so user does not face a redundant game with every replay
- Player can either start or join a game
